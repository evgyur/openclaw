## X ALGORITHM (2025)

**Engagement Weights** (priority order):
1. **Replies** > Reposts > Likes — replies are king
2. **DM shares** — tracked separately, huge boost for "send-able" content
3. **Dwell time** — time spent reading; images/charts/threads help

**Key Signals**:
- `AuthorDiversityScorer` — punishes spam posting; quality > quantity is algorithmic
- Longer threads + image-heavy posts boost dwell time
- Content people DM to friends gets prioritized

**Practical Tactics**:
- Add reply hooks: questions, "agree or disagree?", controversial takes
- Make content "send-able" — relatable, shocking finds, "if you hold X see this"
- Don't rapid-fire post — space it out
- Use images/charts/screenshots — stops scrolling, boosts dwell
- Fewer bangers > many mid posts

**TL;DR**: Algo rewards genuine engagement over vanity metrics. Optimize for replies + shareability, not just likes.

## ARTICLE WRITING GUIDE (Long-form)

### Purpose & Planning
Before writing:
- What do I want the reader to think, feel, or do?
- Who is this actually for?

### Title & Hook
- Specific, spark curiosity, promise value
- Weak: "Tips for Better Productivity in 2026"
- Strong: "Why 95% of Productivity Advice Fails"
- Header images matter — visually appealing + relevant

### Structure for Skimmability
- Short paragraphs (2-4 lines max)
- Subheadings every 3-5 paragraphs
- Bullets/lists over walls of text
- Bold key insight in almost every section
- One idea per paragraph

### Voice & Tone
- Natural, recognizable, consistent
- Write like talking to a good friend
- Use "you" and "your" frequently
- Weak: "Successful people always prioritize their tasks."
- Strong: "You need to stop doing everything. Focus on the 3 things that actually move the needle."

### Show, Don't Tell
For any claim, follow with evidence:
- Statistics
- Personal story
- Before/after comparison
- Embedded posts as examples

### Editing
- Cut 20-30% of word count
- Remove filler: "very," "really," "in order to"
- Read aloud — awkward sentences jump out

### Visuals & Formatting
- Images, screenshots, charts, embedded posts
- Bold headers, spacing, images = more engagement

### Closing Strong
Don't fade out. Options:
- Summarize key points
- Ask a question for replies

### Growth Tactics
